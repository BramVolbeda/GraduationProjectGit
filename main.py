# If line breaking needs to occur around binary operators, like + and *, it should occur before the operator
# PEP 8 recommends that you always use 4 consecutive spaces to indicate indentation.
# Line up the closing brace with the first non-whitespace character of the previous line 
# Surround docstrings with three double quotes on either side, as in """This is a docstring"""
# - Write them for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
# - Put the """ that ends a multiline docstring on a line by itself
# Use .startswith() and .endswith() instead of slicing
